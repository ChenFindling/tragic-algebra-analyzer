# 🎯 Tragic Algebra Analyzer

**Michael Burry's Tragic Algebra and IV15 owners' earnings framework, computed from audited
SEC EDGAR filings.** A free stock valuation tool that measures the true cost of stock-based
compensation — the cash spent on buybacks to offset employee grants, plus the market value of
shares actually delivered — and prices the stock at a 15% required return.

Implements the full formula from *AP SBC: The Tragic Algebra Recurrence*, including the
share-issuance term that pure-dilution companies need, and reproduces Burry's published
figures exactly (see [Validation](#-validation)).

## 📌 The problem: free cash flow lies in software

Standard tools add stock-based compensation back as a "non-cash expense." It is not free.
Granting equity either **dilutes owners** by expanding the share count, or **drains cash**
through buybacks that exist only to neutralise employee grants.

Across the NASDAQ-100 over ten years, that cost totals **$1.73 trillion**. Shareholders keep
about **83 cents** of every reported GAAP dollar — and Wall Street's "adjusted" earnings,
which add SBC back with no offset, overstate the real figure by **42%**.

## 🧮 Tragic Algebra

| Symbol | Meaning | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $N$ | GAAP net income | Income statement |
| $G$ | GAAP SBC expense | Cash flow, operating |
| $C_w$ | Tax withheld on vesting | Cash flow, financing |
| $C_e$ | Option and ESPP proceeds | Cash flow, financing |
| $T$ | Buyback dollars | Cash flow, financing |
| $W$ | Shares repurchased | Repurchase footnote |
| $\Delta S$ | Change in shares outstanding | Balance sheet |

$$I = \Delta S + W \qquad P = T / W \qquad V = I \times P$$

$$C = C_w - C_e \qquad \Omega = C + V \qquad OE = N + G - \Omega \qquad \Delta E = OE / N$$

$\Omega$ **replaces** $G$ rather than supplementing it — leaving the GAAP charge in would
double-count. Pooling over ~10 years uses $\sum OE / \sum N$, never an average of annual
ratios, which blows up on near-zero-earnings years.

### The simplification that makes this automatable

$W$ is almost never tagged in XBRL — it lives in the share repurchase footnote. But since
$P = T/W$:

$$V = T \cdot \frac{W + \Delta S}{W} = T + \frac{T}{W}\Delta S = T + P \cdot \Delta S$$

$W$ cancels. Only the average share price is needed, and that is always obtainable. The
identity is exact and is verified against all ten published Alphabet years using his prices.
What the app substitutes for $P$ is the year's average market price — Burry's own choice for
companies with no buyback, and an approximation for companies that buy back unevenly through
the year. On Salesforce the substitution is worth about four points of ΔE.

### Why ΔE compounds

$\Delta E$ is not a one-off haircut. It applies every year, so intrinsic value per share
retains $\Delta E^{t}$ after $t$ years.

**Break-even is $1/1.15 \approx 87\%$.** Below that, a company needs 15% reported growth just
to hold value per share steady. At the NASDAQ-100's 83.5%, 15% growth still compounds at
**−3.99% a year**.

## 🏰 AICT moat tiers

| Tier | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 2 growth | Terminal cap | Debt capacity | Exit multiple |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Fortress** — regulated or platform, owns its AI | 8y | 16y | 70% | 7.0% | 3.0× EBITDA | 20.0× |
| **Castle** — strong moat, owned AI at scale | 7y | 13y | 55% | 5.0% | 2.5× EBITDA | 16.0× |
| **Chapel** — acute AI threat, real defences | 5y | 10y | 45% | 4.0% | 2.0× EBITDA | 14.5× |
| **Stone** — threatened, limited adaptability | 4y | 7y | 35% | 3.0% | 0 | 9.0× |
| **Wood** — borrowed AI, no credible R&D | 2y | 4y | 25% | 0.0% | 0 | 5.0× |

Total horizon is **24 / 20 / 15 / 11 / 6 years** — not 15 for everything. Tier sets how long
growth lasts and how fast it fades, never the starting rate.

Burry publishes the 15% required return, the two-model structure and the five tier names
with their criteria. **The numbers in this table are not his** — stage durations, growth
multipliers, terminal caps, debt capacity and exit multiples are all this project's
calibration, set so the growth needed to reproduce a published IV15 matches the company's
actual growth. Adobe anchors it: at 14.5×, reaching his $262 needs 11.1% growth, and Adobe
grew 11%.

## 📐 The IV ladder

$IV_n$ is the price returning $n\%$ annually over the long run. Every rung is **one earnings
stream discounted at its own rate** — never scaled off another. Published IV12/IV15 ratios
span 1.33–1.44 across companies, so no constant multiplier fits.

Two models share the stream and are blended:

1. **Long-horizon** — stages 1 and 2, then a terminal perpetuity at the tier cap.
2. **Exit multiple** — project to year 15, apply a market multiple.

**IVB** inverts the ladder: the CAGR today's price implies. It needs no target return chosen
in advance, which arguably makes it the most useful single output.

A **negative IV15 is meaningful** — no share price delivers that return, not even $0.01. The
engine never floors it.

## 🚦 What is calculated vs. what is judgement

| Calculated — trust it | Judgement — yours to set |
| :--- | :--- |
| Every Tragic Algebra term | Normalised recurring owner earnings |
| Pooled ΔE and retention | Stage 1 growth rate |
| The full IV ladder and IVB | Moat tier |
| Split, listing and M&A adjustments | Exit multiple and model blend |

Burry writes thousands of words per company largely to justify the right-hand column. The app
seeds sensible defaults and flags when they cannot be trusted; it does not pretend to replace
the judgement.

## 🚀 Features

* **SEC EDGAR ingestion** — annual facts only, filtered on period duration and deduped by
  filing, with an IFRS fallback for foreign issuers. Rate-limited to ~6.7 req/s with backoff.
* **Watchlist mode** — up to 25 tickers ranked by ΔE, with CSV export. IV15 appears only
  where inputs pass every sanity check.
* **Stress testing** — downgrade the tier and cut growth, then re-value.
* **Calibration** — enter a published IV15 and solve for the growth it implies.
* **Structural adjustments** — stock splits restated onto a current basis (Gate 3
  continuity), listing years and share-funded acquisitions excluded, non-compensation
  issuance deducted from ΔS.
* **Guards that refuse to guess** — dual-class share counts, implausible P/E ratios,
  ΔE outside a meaningful range, financial-sector structures, unbounded growth seeds, and
  balance-sheet lines that stop before net income does all produce a warning rather than a
  confident wrong number. A forward year that is a loss on a profitable record (a one-off
  write-down) seeds owners' earnings from the five-year median and says so.
* **Works at microcap scale** — the year-by-year table chooses its own precision from the
  figures in it, so a company with 3M shares reads in tenths or hundredths of a million
  rather than rounding its stock comp to zero.
* **A second page** implements Chris Mayer's 100-bagger criteria on the same owners'
  earnings: the return a hundredfold in twenty years needs, against what the business has
  delivered and what its return on capital can fund. It is newer and less tested than the
  Tragic Algebra page.

## ⚠️ Known limitations

* **Financials.** Banks, insurers, brokers and REITs get net cash zeroed and a warning. The
  framework was built for software; these need book-value and combined-ratio thinking it does
  not contain.
* **Complex structures.** Up-C partnerships with large non-controlling interests report only
  the parent's slice of income against a full share count.
* **Bundled line items.** Burry reads the 10-K footnotes by hand because filers combine line
  items — the buyback line often carries RSU withholding tax. Because Ω = C + V, that
  particular error cancels here (V is overstated by exactly what C is understated by), and
  this tool never derives price from T/W, so the channel that corrupts his figures does not
  apply. Filers reporting a single net proceeds line are still a genuine gap.
* **M&A share issuance.** Deducted where XBRL tags it, and whole years are excluded when the
  share count jumps more than 15%. Smaller untagged issuance still inflates ΔS.
* **Owner earnings normalisation.** Where ΔE is negative or absurd, the figure must be set by
  hand. Burry does the same — DocuSign's ΔE is deeply negative, yet he assigns ~$195M of
  forward owner earnings on judgement.
* **Paylocity** remains unreconciled against its published IV15. Burry states that he applies
  a judgement discount to Paylocity's ΔE rather than the calculated figure; its size is not
  recoverable from the article, so the app cannot reproduce it.
* **Cash-flow lines that stop early.** A withholding or proceeds line that ends while stock
  comp continues shows in the tag panel but is not yet flagged in the notes.
* **Fiscal year-end changes.** Years are labelled by the calendar year they end in, so a
  company that moved its year end (Build-A-Bear, 2018) reads as having a missing year. The
  note now says which of the two it might be; it cannot yet tell them apart.

## 🛠 Setup

The SEC requires a real contact email in every request header and blocks generic user agents,
so this must be set before anything will load. It is read from Streamlit secrets or an
environment variable, never from the source, so it stays out of the repository.

### Deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud
App → Settings → Secrets:

```toml
sec_contact = "you@example.com"
```

### Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export SEC_CONTACT="you@example.com"     # Windows: set SEC_CONTACT=you@example.com
streamlit run app.py
```

Or create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with the same `sec_contact` line — Streamlit reads it
automatically. **Add `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to your `.gitignore`** so it is never
committed.

Use an address you actually monitor. The SEC's fair-access policy exists so they can contact
you if an app misbehaves, and a dead address risks a block. A dedicated one is sensible, since
anything in a public repo gets scraped.

If the contact is missing the app shows a warning at the top and every lookup fails.

Dependencies: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `requests`. Nothing else.
