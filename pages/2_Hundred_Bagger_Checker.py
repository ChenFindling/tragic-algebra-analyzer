"""
100-Bagger Checker
==================
Christopher Mayer's criteria, checked against the filings, with Michael Burry's
fully-adjusted return on invested capital as the centrepiece.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
Not a screener. It takes one ticker you already like and tells you which of
Mayer's conditions the filings support, which they contradict, and which cannot
be answered from EDGAR at all.

THE ARITHMETIC THAT DOES MOST OF THE WORK
-----------------------------------------
A 100-bagger is two engines multiplied: earnings growth and multiple change.

    100  =  (1+g)^N  x  (M_exit / M_now)  /  (1+dilution)^N

Solve for g and you get the growth rate the business must actually deliver.
Then compare it against what its own return on capital allows:

    g_max  =  ROIC  x  reinvestment rate

Nothing outgrows its return on capital for long, because growth has to be
funded and reinvested profit is the only self-funded source. When the required
rate sits above the ceiling, the case is not optimistic — it is arithmetically
closed, and no amount of narrative reopens it.

That comparison is the whole tool. Everything else is the work of computing the
two numbers honestly.

BURRY'S ROIC
------------
    ROIC = (Owners' earnings - interest income - capital lease payments
            - other expense)
           / (total capital - LT operating leases - net cash + other capital)

Owners' earnings come from the Tragic Algebra engine, ported unchanged from
tool 1 so both pages agree to the dollar. The rest is assembled from the
balance sheet, with two rules that matter:

  * Only genuinely deployable cash leaves the capital base. Restricted,
    regulated and operationally-tied cash funds the business and stays in.
  * Anything not obtainable from XBRL is exposed as an input seeded at zero
    and labelled as judgement, never guessed and quietly folded in.

#
#  One question, asked in one place: is the growth this price requires
#  inside what the business can fund and has ever managed?
#
#  Three rates, and the answer is which of them is smallest:
#    NEEDS      required_growth, from the price you pay and the multiple
#               you assume at the end
#    CAN FUND   ROIC x retention, plus whatever a shrinking share count
#               adds. Capital's ceiling.
#    HAS DONE   what it has actually delivered. History's ceiling.
#
#  Neither ceiling is a law. Capital's can be raised by borrowing;
#  history's can be broken by a genuinely new business. But when the
#  required rate sits above both, the case is closed by arithmetic
#  rather than by opinion, and that is worth saying plainly.
