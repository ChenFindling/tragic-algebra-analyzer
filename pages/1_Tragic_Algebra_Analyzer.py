Tragic Algebra Analyzer
===================
Owners' earnings adjusted for the true cost of stock compensation, then the
intrinsic value ladder that follows from them.

THE KEY SIMPLIFICATION
----------------------
The published cost formula is  V = T x (W + dS) / W  , which needs W, the number
of shares repurchased. W is almost never tagged in XBRL — it lives in the share
repurchase footnote.

But P = T / W, so:

    V = T x (W + dS)/W  =  T + (T/W) x dS  =  T + P x dS

W cancels. Only the average share price is needed, and that is always
obtainable. Verified exact against all ten published Alphabet years.

So:
    V  = max(0, T + P x dS)      market value of shares handed to employees
    C  = Cw - Ce                 net cash award payments
    Om = C + V                   true SBC cost, replaces GAAP's estimate
    OE = N + G - Om              owners' earnings
    dE = OE / N                  fraction of reported profit that is really yours

Pooled over ~10 years as sum(OE)/sum(N) — never an average of annual ratios.
